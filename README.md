# HMMERTIME Analysis Research Compendium 

The structure of this research compendium loosely follows the framework of an R-package for reproducing our analysis (for more information on research compendiums, see [ROpenSci Team](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg)). We are going to be weaving together python and R scripts, so a working knowledge of both languages will be needed (pyton: basic; R: intermediate).  

An overview of the compendium is below: 
```
├── R                                 # "Helper" R functions specific to this research project 
├── README.md
|                           
```

### Running the Code

## Important Notes
:warning: For those of you who did not have the pleasure of growing up as 90's kid in America, the code may exhibit strange behaviors unless this [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJskIJGEsd8) is put on repeat while you work through this repo.
